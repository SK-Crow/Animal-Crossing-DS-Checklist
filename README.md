# About
This project aims to be a good quality tracker for Animal Crossing: Wild World for Nintendo DS.

Live site: https://acds.sterner.digital/

# Roadmap
ACDS has a [Github Project](https://github.com/users/SK-Crow/projects/5) with a to-do list.  This is effectively what I'm using for a roadmap.  No intention to publish the app or remove the WIP popup until everything here is completed.

# /docs/
Github pages pulls directly from this folder.  Please do not directly modify these files.  This should be wiped & re-deployed to update the app for all users.

# /project/
Contains source files.  Project is built with Noodl.  I recommend using Code Crusher's fork:
